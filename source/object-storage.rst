Object storage
##############

The ideal service to store data for websites, web applications, mobile
applications, IoT sensors, and devices. Object storage can also be used for
data archival, data lakes, backups and disaster recovery.

Designed for 99.999999999% of durability, objects are automatically replicated
to preserve three copies of the data, one in each region of the Catalyst Cloud.
All object storage operations are done via a modern and easy to use REST API.
