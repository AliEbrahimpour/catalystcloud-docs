Overview
********

The web dashboard is a simple way to interact with The Catalyst Cloud. It can
be found at https://dashboard.clould.catalyst.net.nz.

.. note::

  When a new feature is introduced to our cloud, it is first exposed via a REST
  API, followed by the command line clients and finally the web dashboard. It
  usually takes 3-6 months for it to reach the dashboard, but it can be used
  well ahead of that via the API and command line clients.
