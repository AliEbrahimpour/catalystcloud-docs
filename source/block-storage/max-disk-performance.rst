*************
I/O Readahead
*************

It is recommended to increase the I/O readahead value for the volume to improve
performance. This parameter determines the number of kilobytes that the kernel
will read ahead during a sequential read operation.

The default value for this is 128KB but it is possible to increase this up to
around 2048KB. This should drastically improve sequential read performance, and
can be done using a script in /etc/udev/rules.d/.

Here is an example of what this script might look like.

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo cat /etc/udev/rules.d/read-ahead-kb.rules
  SUBSYSTEM=="block", KERNEL=="vd[a-z]" ACTION=="add|change",
  ATTR{queue/read_ahead_kb}="1024"

This change is highly recommended if your workload is doing a lot of large
streaming reads.
