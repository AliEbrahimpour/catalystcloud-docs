The compute service provides scalable on-demand compute capacity for your
applications in the form of compute instances. Compute instances are virtual
servers that can be scaled up, down, or horizontally (by adding and removing
more compute instances).

Please refer to the :ref:`launch-first-instance` tutorial for step by step
guidance on how to launch your first compute instance (and the pre-requisites
to do so).
