The compute service provides scalable on-demand compute capacity for your
applications in the form of compute instances. Compute instances are virtual
servers that can be scaled up, down, or horizontally (by adding and removing
more compute instances).

When booting compute instances, you can choose from a list of pre-configured
operating system images (Linux and Windows), or to upload your own using the
imaging service.
