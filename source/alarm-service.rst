.. _alarm-service:

The Alarm service that we use on the Catalyst Cloud is AODH. It allows you to
create alarms the will notify other programs based on certain criteria that you
define. In this documentation we go over the fundamentals of AODH and then
show you two examples of using alarms to create a system that can autoheal and
autoscale its instances.
