Identity and access management
##############################


Also known as (IAM). Is a set of rules, which governs an individual accounts
level of access to different resources that are available on your cloud
project. It does this on the Catalyst Cloud through the use of Roles.
The practices mention in the following sections will discuss in detail what
the different roles on a the Catalyst Cloud platform are and how you are able
to manage them as an administrative user.

Also covered in this section is Multi-factor-authentication, which we recommend
using and which we highly recommend using for any account which has the
'project-administrator' role.
