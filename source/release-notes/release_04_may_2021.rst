A large change to the database service with this release. We have officially
changed the designation the database service from being a technical preview
to being in an open Beta.

****************************************
Database as a service(Trove)
****************************************

Database service Beta
=====================

We are moving into an open beta for our database as a service offering. This
means that customers now will have the ability to create their own managed
database resources on the Catalyst Cloud. This also means that those customers
who engaged previously in the technical preview of the service will begin
being charged for the resources they are consuming from this service.

The Beta for this service has two datastore images available for use, those
being PostgreSQL and MySQL. Documentation around these will be included in
the rest of this documentation under the :ref:`database_page` section.

Database dashboard functionality
================================

Alongside our database being moved from technical preview to open beta, we are
also bringing a GUI for creating database resources using our dashboard. It is
important to note though that this service is still in Beta and so some of the
dashboard functions are not fully fleshed out as of this moment in time. We will
resolve these issues before moving the service out of beta.
