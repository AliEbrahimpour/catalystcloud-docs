Using the CLI
#############

**If you installed the CLI using pip:**

1. :ref:`activate-venv`
2. :ref:`source-rc-file`
3. Invoke the CLI with the ``openstack`` command

**If you installed the CLI using docker:**

1. :ref:`source-rc-file`
2. Invoke the CLI with the ``ccloud`` alias anywhere the ``openstack`` command is otherwise used.

For a reference of all commands supported by the CLI, refer to the `OpenStack
Client documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient>`_.

****************
Finding your way
****************

The command ``openstack help`` will list all commands supported by the
OpenStack CLI. You can then use ``openstack COMMAND --help`` to understand how
to use a command.
