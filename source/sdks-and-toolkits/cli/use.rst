Using the CLI
#############

The CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to control all parts of the Catalyst
Cloud.
Now that we have all the necessary components to run the CLI, we can get to
using it. Two important things to not before continuing:
remember to :ref:`activate-venv` and
:ref:`source-rc-file`.

For a reference of all commands supported by the CLI, refer to the `OpenStack
Client documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient>`_.

The Next Step
*************

We highly recommend that if you are going to be using the CLI often that you
take the time to go through the documentation section on :ref:`setting up your
first instance <using-the-command-line-interface>`, using the CLI method. It
gives you a great step-by-step process to how to create an instance but also
teaches you the common commands found in openstack and the CLI.
