Using the CLI
#############


**If you installed the CLI using pip:**

1. :ref:`activate-venv`
2. :ref:`source-rc-file`
3. Invoke the CLI with the ``openstack`` command

**If you installed the CLI using docker:**

1. :ref:`source-rc-file`
2. Invoke the CLI with the ``ccloud`` alias anywhere the ``openstack`` command
   is otherwise used.


For a reference of all commands supported by the CLI, refer to the `OpenStack
Client documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient>`_.

The Next Step
*************

We highly recommend that if you are going to be using the CLI often that you
take the time to go through the documentation section on :ref:`setting up your
first instance <using-the-command-line-interface>`, using the CLI method. It
gives you a great step-by-step process to how to create an instance but also
teaches you the common commands found in openstack and the CLI.
