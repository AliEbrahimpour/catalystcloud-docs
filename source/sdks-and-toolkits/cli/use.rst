Using the CLI
#############

Before using the CLI, always remember to :ref:`activate-venv` and
:ref:`source-rc-file`.

For a reference of all commands supported by the CLI, refer to the `OpenStack
Client documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient>`_.

****************
Finding your way
****************

The command ``openstack help`` will list all commands supported by the
OpenStack CLI. You can then use ``openstack COMMAND --help`` to understand how
to use a command.
