Quotas
######

The Catalyst Cloud provides customers with a quota mechanism to protect them from accidentally launching too many resources and having a big surprise with their invoices. In fact, every cloud provider has a similar mechanism, but many do not expose this information back to customers.

We allow customers to see their current per region quota on the overview page of the dashboard. Quotas are a soft cap that can be changed any time according to the customer needs. You can request a quota change via the support panel: https://dashboard.cloud.catalyst.net.nz/management/tickets/

Catalyst may give you a call if you are about to exceed your quota and ask you whether you would like us to pro-actively increase it for you.
