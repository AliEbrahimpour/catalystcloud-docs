The basics of Sky TV cloud
############################

This section of the documentation is for people that are entirely new to cloud
computing.

The Sky TV cloud is a computing platform built
with the open source project, `OpenStack`_ using the Catalyst Cloud
inferstructure. OpenStack allows users like yourself to provision services.
Provisioning is similar to renting. You can provision things such as storage
space, compute capacity, or internet access. The building blocks you need to
run a business's applications.

.. note::
   Openstack requires a python enterpriter to function and
   is currently phasing out it's support for Python2. We therefore recommend
   running Openstack using Python3.

OpenStack gives you the ability to provision no more or less than what you
need, by allowing you to change how much you're using quickly, easily, and
automatically, through a variety of tools.


Now we understand the basic idea behind the Sky TV cloud, let's explore what
services are provided.
