Getting support
###############

If you need help, you can raise a support request to Catalyst via the `Support
Requests <https://dashboard.cloud.catalyst.net.nz/management/tickets/>`_ panel.

Most requests are resolved within one business day. If you would like faster
response times or additional support, please consider purchasing one of our
`premium support packages
<https://catalyst.net.nz/catalyst-cloud/premium-support>`_. Our target response
times for priority one incidents are listed on the `premium support page
<https://catalyst.net.nz/catalyst-cloud/premium-support>`_.
