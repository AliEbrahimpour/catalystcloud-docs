Raising a support request
=========================

If you need help, you can raise a support request with Catalyst via the `Support
Requests <https://dashboard.cloud.catalyst.net.nz/management/tickets/>`_ panel.

Most requests are resolved within one business day. If you would like faster
response times or additional support, please consider purchasing one of our
`premium support packages
<https://catalystcloud.nz/support/premium-support/>`_. Our target response
times for priority one incidents are listed on the `premium support page
<https://catalystcloud.nz/support/premium-support/>`_.

Contacting your account manager
===============================

Customers that have a premium support contract from Catalyst have a technical account
manager. You should have received the contact details for your account manager when you
applied for premium support.


Contacting a solutions architect
================================

Premium support customers have access to cloud solution architects who can
provide guidance on the best way to implement your applications on the cloud.
Please contact your account manager to arrange a discussion with a cloud
solutions architect.
