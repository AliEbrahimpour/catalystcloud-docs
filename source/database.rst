Overview
********

The goal of the database service is to provide a quick and easy way for all
cloud users, not just database administrators, to add database functionality
into their cloud projects without having to worry about the administrative
tasks usually associated with this type of service. This means that they can
provision and manage both relational and non-relational database instances on
an as required basis.


As well as the ability to deploy databases instances the database service also
provides the ability to configure and patch these instances as well as backup
and restore data.
