High availability

This documentation outlines the physical infrastructure and software features that make the Catalyst Cloud highly available and resilient. It covers built in features that are inherited by every project and services that can be used to enhance the availability of web applications and web sites hosted on the Catalyst Cloud.

Physical Infrastructure
=======================

The Catalyst Cloud is hosted on multiple regions or geographical locations. Regions 
are completely independent and isolated from each other, providing fault tolerance 
and geographic diversity. This section describes the physical attributes of our data 
centres.
