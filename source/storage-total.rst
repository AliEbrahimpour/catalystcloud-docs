Storage on the Catalyst Cloud
#############################

Our catalyst cloud offeres two types of storage. There is the more traditional
``block storage``, which allows you to partition a set size of storage and then
mount it onto an instance.

The second kind of storage that we offer is ``object storage``.
This works differently than what you may be used to. Instead of having a set
size of storage that you are able to use, you instead upload the files that
you want stored onto our cloud and we only charge you for the size of the file
you've uploaded, instead of being charged for an entire block.

More information on both, and the tutorials on how to create both are in the
following pages:
