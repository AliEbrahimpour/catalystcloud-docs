Load Balancer
#############

Load balancing is the action of taking front-end requests and distributing these
across a pool of back-end servers for processing based on a series of rules. The
load balancer service encapsulates the complexity of implementing a typical load
balancing solution into an easy to use cloud based service that natively
provides a multi-tenanted, highly scaleable programmable alternative.
