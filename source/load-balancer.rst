Load balancer
#############

Load balancing is the action of taking front-end requests and distributing
these across a pool of back-end servers for processing based on a series of
rules.

The load balancer service encapsulates the complexity of implementing a typical
load balancing solution into an easy to use cloud based service that natively
provides a multi-tenanted, highly scalable, and programmable alternative.
